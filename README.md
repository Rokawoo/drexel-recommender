**My Contribution:**

Designed and developed a unique web application in a collaborative team effort.
Our app is an innovative product sorting concept that can be implemented in any
webstore, leveraging customized sorting algorithms and a personalized AI shopping
assistant. My main contributions include the creation and integration of the
entire frontend UI / UX, product graphics, and AI shopping assistant.
